## Testing Your Setup

3. **Edit content:** Go to admin and modify the markdown fields
4. **See changes:** Refresh the main page to see rendered markdown

## Sample Content

I've already populated your 2019 conference with sample markdown content to demonstrate the features. You can:
- View it on the main page
- Edit it in the admin
- Use it as a template for other conferences

## Next Steps

1. **Customize the content** in Django admin
2. **Add more conferences** with markdown descriptions
3. **Extend other models** (like Speaker bios) to use markdown
4. **Customize the styling** by modifying the CSS in the markdown template tags

Your website now supports professional-grade markdown rendering with all the modern features you'd expect! 🎉
