        <p>
          Decentralized artificial intelligence and robotics have the potential to
          revolutionize many applications. Boosted by technological advancements,
          such as cloud computing and novel hardware design; nowadays AI (virtual)
          and robotics (physical) are starting to become an important part of
          activities such as logistics, autonomous transportation, emergency
          management and healthcare. However, several of the characteristics that
          make these systems ideal for certain future applications —autonomy,
          learning, knowledge sharing, collaboration, cooperation, etc.— can also
          raise concerns in the evolution of the technology from academic
          institutions into the public sphere. For instance, controlling the
          behavior of large teams of autonomous agents (either physical or virtual)
          still presents unique challenges for human operators. In addition,
          important issues in the fields of data privacy, security, safety, and
          transparency can become burdens for the future use of AI and robotics in
          high-sensitive scenarios. Therefore, novel solutions to these issues might
          be necessary steps towards mainstream adoption. Blockchain, an emerging
          technology originated in the time-stamping field in the 1990s and recently
          in digital currency sector, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer
          networks with cryptographic algorithms, agents can reach agreements in a
          transparent and decentralized manner without the need for a controlling
          authority. For instance, blockchain-based applications such as "smart
          contracts" are already showing great potential to make distributed
          robotics operations more secure, autonomous, flexible, and even
          profitable. Therefore, blockchain promises a way to bridge the gap between
          purely scientific domains and real-world applications. This Call of Papers
          (CFP) seeks to move beyond the classical view of distributed and
          decentralized systems to advance our understanding about the possibilities
          of combining autonomous agents (either physical or virtual) with
          blockchain-based technologies. Insights about the following questions are
          especially important: What blockchain tools are available to increase the
          auditability, transparency, and reliability of AI and robotics? What kind
          of algorithms are suitable to combine both technologies? Are there new
          models and methods to connect autonomous agents to blockchain-based
          innovations such as "smart contracts"? Is blockchain technology a suitable
          way to achieve emergent aggregations of autonomous and self-adaptive
          agents? Are distributed networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tezos,
          etc. a feasible way to integrate AI and robotics in our society? Are there
          new business models for AI and robotics based on cryptographic algorithms?
