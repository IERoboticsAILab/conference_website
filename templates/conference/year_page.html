           blah blah Robotics and AI systems are starting to revolutionize many applications,
            from transportation to health care, assisted by technological
            advancements, such as cloud computing and novel hardware design.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, several of the characteristics that make these systems ideal
            for certain future applications such as autonomy, self-learning,
            knowledge sharing, can also raise concerns in the evolution of the
            technology from academic institutions into the public sphere.
            Blockchain is starting to show great potential to make robotics and AI
            operations more secure, autonomous, flexible, and even profitable.
            Therefore, bridging the gap between purely scientific domains and real-
            world applications.

            This symposium seeks to move beyond the classical view of distributed
            systems to advance our understanding about the possibilities and
            limitations of combining state-of-the art robotics and AI systems with
            blockchain technology.

            Decentralized artificial intelligence and robotics have the potential to
            revolutionize many applications. Boosted by technological advancements,
            such as cloud computing and novel hardware design; nowadays AI (virtual)
            and robotics (physical) are starting to become an important part of
            activities such as logistics, autonomous transportation, emergency
            management and healthcare. However, several of the characteristics that
            make these systems ideal for certain future applications â€”autonomy,
            learning, knowledge sharing, collaboration, cooperation, etc.â€” can also
            raise concerns in the evolution of the technology from academic
            institutions into the public sphere. For instance, controlling the
            behavior of large teams of autonomous agents (either physical or virtual)
            still presents unique challenges for human operators. In addition,
            important issues in the fields of data privacy, security, safety, and
            transparency can become burdens for the future use of AI and robotics in
            high-sensitive scenarios. Therefore, novel solutions to these issues might
            be necessary steps towards mainstream adoption. Blockchain, an emerging
            technology originated in the time-stamping field in the 1990s and recently
            in digital currency sector, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer
            networks with cryptographic algorithms, agents can reach agreements in a
            transparent and decentralized manner without the need for a controlling
            authority. For instance, blockchain-based applications such as "smart
            contracts" are already showing great potential to make distributed
            robotics operations more secure, autonomous, flexible, and even
            profitable. Therefore, blockchain promises a way to bridge the gap between
            purely scientific domains and real-world applications. This Call of Papers
            (CFP) seeks to move beyond the classical view of distributed and
            decentralized systems to advance our understanding about the possibilities
            of combining autonomous agents (either physical or virtual) with
            blockchain-based technologies. Insights about the following questions are
            especially important: What blockchain tools are available to increase the
            auditability, transparency, and reliability of AI and robotics? What kind
            of algorithms are suitable to combine both technologies? Are there new
            models and methods to connect autonomous agents to blockchain-based
            innovations such as "smart contracts"? Is blockchain technology a suitable
            way to achieve emergent aggregations of autonomous and self-adaptive
            agents? Are distributed networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tezos,
            etc. a feasible way to integrate AI and robotics in our society? Are there
            new business models for AI and robotics based on cryptographic algorithms?
          </p>
